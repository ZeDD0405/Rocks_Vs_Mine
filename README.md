# Rocks Vs Mine - ML Classification Project

This is my first small machine learning project, where I built a classification model to differentiate between rocks and mines using sonar signal data. The project helped me understand the full ML pipeline from data loading to prediction.

## 🧠 What I Did
- Loaded and explored the sonar dataset (208 samples, 60 features)
- Preprocessed the data and split into training and test sets
- Trained a Logistic Regression model using `scikit-learn`
- Evaluated model accuracy on both training and test data
- Built a simple system to make predictions for new input data

## 📈 Results
- **Training accuracy**: ~83%
- **Test accuracy**: ~76%
- Final model used: **Logistic Regression**

## 📁 File(s)
- `rock_vs_mine_model.ipynb` – The complete notebook with code, outputs, and explanation

## 📌 Notes
- Dataset: UCI Sonar Dataset
- This project is for learning purposes and does not use advanced tuning or cross-validation.
